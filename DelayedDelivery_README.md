#Delayed Email Delivery Macro for Outlook
This macro for Outlook allows you to send an email at a delayed delivery time of 6:00 AM. This is useful if you want to compose an email outside of regular business hours, but don't want to send it until the next morning.

#Requirements
- Microsoft Outlook installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of using macros in Outlook

#Installation
- Open Microsoft Outlook and press ALT + F11 to open the VBA editor.
- Create a new module by clicking on the "Insert" menu and selecting "Module".
- Copy and paste the code from the DelayedDelivery.vba file into the new module.
- Save the module with a descriptive name, such as "DelayedDeliveryMacro".
- Close the VBA editor.

#Usage
- Compose a new email or open an existing email that you want to delay.
- Click on the "Developer" tab in the ribbon (if it's not visible, you may need to enable it in Outlook's settings).
- Click on the "Macros" button in the ribbon and select the "DelayedDeliveryMacro" macro.
- The macro will set the delivery time to 6:00 AM and send the email.

#Customization
You can modify the email details, such as the recipient email address, email subject, and email body, by editing the code in the macro.

You can also change the delivery time to a different time by modifying the TimeValue("06:00:00") code in the macro. For example, if you want to set the delivery time to 8:30 AM, you can change the code to TimeValue("08:30:00").
